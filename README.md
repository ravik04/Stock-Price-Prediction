Project Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting of stock prices using multiple approaches, including ARIMA modeling and deep learning techniques such as LSTMs. The goal is to analyze stock price data, check for stationarity, perform time series transformations, and apply predictive models to forecast future stock prices.


Technologies & Libraries Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)\
Statsmodels (for ARIMA modeling and ADF test)\
TensorFlow & Keras (for deep learning models)\
Auto-correlation & Time Series Resampling\
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for development
